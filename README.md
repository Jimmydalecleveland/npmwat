# npmwat

A simple CLI tool that lists out the `package.json` scripts in a directory, and then allows filtering over them.
It also detects if a `yarn.lock` is present and changes the commands run to use `yarn`.

## Getting started

Install it:

```bash
npm i -g npmwat
```

Run it:

```bash
npmwat
```
